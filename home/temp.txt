Given Tom is a data scientist at an insurance firm who works on risk prediction.

- How to combine existing **rule-based models** with the **emerging ML models**?
- During the combination process, how to eliminate **bias** and **discrimination**? What type of **calibration** should be done?
- Is there a possibility to provide **interpretability** to certain extent?
- Ultimately, what is the **implication** of this transformation process? Is this transferable?

PhD Specialization in Data Science
The Ph.D. specialization in Data Science is an option within each participating department's PhD program.
The current participating departments are Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, and Statistics.
PhD students in these departments can choose to do this specialization.
To participate, students need to fulfill the requirements below in addition to those of their respective department's PhD program.
Students should discuss this specialization option with their PhD advisor and their department's Director for Graduate Studies.
Further questions about the specialization requirements should be directed to Professor David Blei (CS and Stats).

My research interest spans **data mining algorithms, systems, applications, and real-world implications**.
After I joined the Heinz College, **Information systems**, especially how machine learning impacts our daily life,
arises as my new interest.

I am also appointed as the [GSA International Student Co-Advocate](https://www.cmu.edu/stugov/gsa/About-the-GSA/Execs.html),
defending for the rights of graduate international students.
[The Graduate Student Assembly (GSA)](https://www.cmu.edu/stugov/gsa/About-the-GSA/index.html) is
the branch of student government that represents all 7,000+ graduate students at CMU.

I have an open (if not crazy) mind for all sorts of opportunities,
e.g., industry research labs, universities, NGOs, and think tanks. The key ask is to use data mining techniques
for solving **impactful real-world problems**.

**[w19a]** HD-Cluster: Synthesized Cluster Analysis and Outlier Detection on High-dimensional Data.

[**#3**] From Oct 2019 to May 2020, I am a [GSA International Student Co-Advocate](https://www.cmu.edu/stugov/gsa/About-the-GSA/Execs.html),
along with Sandra Fomete.
[The Graduate Student Assembly (GSA)](https://www.cmu.edu/stugov/gsa/About-the-GSA/index.html) is
the branch of student government that represents all graduate students at CMU.
I am working with administrators at different levels and student groups to improve international graduate students' experience at CMU.
My core focus includes immigration (visa and CPT/OPT), career
development, and mental health issues, which are particularly relevant to international students.
<span style="color:green">If you are a CMU graduate student that wants to discuss related issues with me, please shoot me an email.</span>

<span style="color:green">Oct 2019</span>: I had a talk on "text generation by generative models". Check out the [slides](misc/Text-Generation-from-Uncontrollable-to-Controllable.pdf).

Neither Anomaly nor noise gets a clear definition in data mining as they may look similar in many ways.
In fact, the convention is calling noise as "weak outliers", in comparison to true anomalies that analysts care. Loosely speaking,
anomalies are the subjects we are interested in, while noise is not. However, they are convertible in both directions.
In this work, we revisit the problem and define noise with five properties.
Based on these properties, the benchmark of various outlier detection methods along with newly created datasets in differentiating noise is provided.
Lastly, a two-stage denoising framework is proposed to better separate noise from anomalies.


The key idea is to incorporate the existing labels into unsupervised generative models. This idea is inspired by the discussion at [Economing I](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/programs/courses/47958.html).


**Longer version**: **my interests lie on the applied side of the learning algorithms**. I especially care why, when, and how to use learning models to bring **social impact**.
In addition to propose new ensemble learning, outlier detection, and clustering **algorithms**,
I design and implement accessible and scalable machine learning **systems and libraries** as well.
More importantly, I enjoy applying learning algorithms to solve real-world problems (e.g., healthcare, education, security, and finance),
i.e., build **applications** and understand their **implications**.

Before joining CMU, I earned my MS degree from University of Toronto (2016) and BS degree from University of Cincinnati (2015), and worked as a senior consultant at [PwC Canada](https://www.pwc.com/ca/en.html) (2016-19).


**Contributions Machine Learning Systems for Anomaly Detection and Out-of-distribution (OOD) Detection**:
I use *machine learning systems (MLSys)* techniques to support large-scale,
real-world outlier detection applications in security, finance, and healthcare with millions of downloads.
I designed CPU-based ([PyOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod)),
GPU-based ([TOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/tod)),
distributed detection systems ([SUOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/suod))
for tabular ([PyOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod)), time-series ([TODS](https://github.com/datamllab/tods)),
and graph data ([PyGOD](https://github.com/pygod-team/pygod)).
To understand the characteristics of OD algorithms, I co-author *large-scale benchmarks* for tabular data ([ADBench](https://openreview.net/forum?id=foA_SFQ9zo0)),
time-series data ([paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r8IvOsnHchr)), and graph data ([BOND](https://openreview.net/forum?id=YXvGXEmtZ5N)).
My work has been widely used by thousands of *projects and applications*, including
Amazon, IBM, Morgan Stanley, and Tesla. See [more applications](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod/network/dependents).


**Sep 2022**: [Artificial Intelligence Foundation for Therapeutic Science](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01131-2) published in ***Nature Chemical Biology***.
The paper describes [Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC)](https://tdcommons.ai/) and its various use cases, laying the foundation of therapeutic science.

**Sep 2022**: Two *large-scale anomaly detection benchmarks* for tabular data ([ADBench](https://openreview.net/forum?id=foA_SFQ9zo0)) and graph data ([BOND](https://openreview.net/forum?id=YXvGXEmtZ5N)) accepted at NeurIPS 2022.
