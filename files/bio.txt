Dr. Yue Zhao is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Southern California and a faculty member of the USC Machine Learning Center. His research focuses on developing robust, efficient, and automated machine learning (ML) and data mining (DM) algorithms, systems, and applications. This includes enhancing AI systems with out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, outlier detection (OD), and anomaly detection; building efficient and automated ML systems with minimal supervision; applying AI to challenges in security, finance, healthcare, and AI4Science; and exploring how foundation models and generative AI intersect with OD/OOD detection. Dr. Zhao has contributed over 40 papers to leading venues and is renowned for his open-source ML systems, including PyOD, PyGOD, TDC, and TrustLLM, which have garnered over 20,000 GitHub stars and 22 million downloads. His projects are used by organizations such as NASA, Morgan Stanley, and the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs. He has received recognition including the Amazon Research Awards, AAAI New Faculty Highlights Award, Google Cloud Research Innovators, Norton Fellowship, Meta AI4AI Research Award, and CMU Presidential Fellowship. Dr. Zhao serves as an associate editor for IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS), an action editor for the Journal of Data-centric Machine Learning Research (DMLR), a workflow co-chair for KDD 2023, and an area chair for several ML conferences.
